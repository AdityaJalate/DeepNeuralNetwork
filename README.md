# Deep Neural Network: Step-by-Step Implementation and Application

# Overview

This repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks that guide you through the implementation and application of a deep neural network. The project is divided into two parts:

# Part 1: Building a Deep Neural Network – Implements key functions for deep learning.

# Part 2: Image Classification Using Deep Neural Networks – Uses the functions from Part 1 to classify images.

# Notebook Contents

# Part 1: Building a Deep Neural Network

Introduction – Overview of neural networks.

Forward Propagation – Implementing linear and activation functions.

Backward Propagation – Computing gradients for optimization.

Parameter Initialization – Setting up weights and biases.

Training the Model – Using gradient descent to minimize loss.

# Part 2: Image Classification Using Deep Neural Networks

Applying the Implemented Functions – Using functions from Part 1.

Dataset Loading – Loading and preprocessing image data.

Training the Deep Model – Training a multi-layer neural network.

Evaluating the Model – Assessing accuracy on a classification task (Cat vs. Non-Cat).

# Learning Outcomes
